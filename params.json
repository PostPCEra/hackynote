It's a try to implements as much good principles of code design as possible.\r\nThis is the nature of HackyNote, it's more valuable to delivery a very well crafted refactoring thats makes the code cleaner than a bunch of new features that decrement the code quality.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdding Themes & Transitions\r\n----------------------\r\n1.  Fork this repository.\r\n2.  Add your theme or transitions css to 'themes/[yourthemenamehere].css' or 'transitions/[yourthemenamehere].css'\r\n3.  Add an entry to `themes.json` or 'transitions.json' with these properties:\r\n\r\n        {\r\n          \"name\": \"My Theme\",  // name of transition/theme ( will be displayied under the menu )\r\n          \"css\": \"themes/my_theme.css\" // file of transition/theme ( will be loaded by the app )\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n4.  Make sure that it looks alright by running `./scripts/web-server.js` (requires Node.js)\r\n5.
